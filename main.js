// Click addEventListener - for flipping the books -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

//want to use classes to distinguise which pair matches with witch. for and if loops? 

//want to try to randomize which books get places where so each game is different. Possibly make them into an array and use math.floor(math.random);




// Win & Loose Conditionals -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// When two books are matched, have them dissapear - use classes and .remove


// If there is a mis-match - trigger phone noise and deduct a life (maybe in top corner?)
// -how to keep track of misses - should I keep track of the number of flips that don't trigger the win condition?



// End Game - not sure if needs to be seperate from Win/Lose -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Maybe have game clear and lose page appear.
