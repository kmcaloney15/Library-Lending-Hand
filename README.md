# Library Memory Game

# Premise
The library is a mess. You've been asked to help the librarian organize and put away all of the books that got pulled after a school group came through.  There are two copies of each book that need to be shelved together. 

# Game Play
The user will take turns turning flipping any two books. If you find two of the same books, they will disappear to be sorted.  If you are able match all of the books, you win! 

However, every time you flip over a mis-matched pair, your cell phone will go off. The library has a strict noise volume policy. If you phones goes off four times, you will be asked to leave the library, so choose carefully!

# Future ideas:
• create a welcome page that introduces the library, and they have to click start or play game to enter. 

• in the future I'd like to adapt this for mobile phones and make an app for it
